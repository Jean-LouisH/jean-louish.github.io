# Software Projects

This is a quick showcase of my presentable software projects on GitHub. You can click the project titles in this list to see additional information.

You can also find my [GitHub Profile here](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH) and the rest of my [Project Repositories here](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH?tab=repositories). 

# Applications

## [Lilliputian](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Lilliputian)

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/Lilliputian/master/Screenshot.png)

A tiny 2D game engine and IDE for introductory game development, prototyping and programming learning. Its sole purpose is to provide the user with the entire development process in a single application and make it as simple as possible.

## [ElecCirSim](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/ElecCirSim)

A real-time analogue and digital [circuit simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit_simulation). 

# Scripts

## [Abstract Name Generator](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/AbstractNameGenerator)

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/AbstractNameGenerator/main/Screenshot.png)

This is a script to take a syllable count from the user, generate a permutation list of abstract syllables and allow the user to choose how and which will be presented to them. 

## [Title Case Converter](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/TitleCaseConverter)

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/TitleCaseConverter/main/Screenshot.png)

Converts an input string into title case according to the Chicago Manual of Style, with capitalization for non-grammatrical words. This may be useful, for example, in article headlines and content creation platforms.

# Just For Fun

These are developed for my use only. Most of these may be useless or unrealistic in scope or utility, but might have some aesthetic, code or designs of interest to others.

## [Lania](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Lania)

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/Lania/master/Documentation/Images/Screenshot.gif)

My hobbyist and experimental 2D/3D game engine.

## [Libretti](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti)

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti/master/Screenshot.gif)

Libretti is a music synthesizer library for integration with applications. It can compile audio data from text files that are written with [Libretti's scripting language](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti/blob/master/Documentation/Scripting%20Language%20Specification.txt)

## [Suprannua Engine](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/SuprannuaEngine)

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/SuprannuaEngine/master/Documentation/Images/Screenshot.gif)

A superannuated, 2D platformer game engine codebase. My first project ever.
You can [download all the games and tests I've made with Suprannua Engine here.](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/SuprannuaEngine/releases/download/v0.14.0-alpha/Suprannua.0.14.0.Games.Tests.zip). All movement is done through WASD keys where not specified.

## [Imperium](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Imperium)

My hobbyist general purpose imperative programming language with a bias towards compiled, high-performance applications.

# For My Learning

These are developed as I progress with learning materials and tutorials or by prototypesto test concepts before implementing them in other projects.

## [Learn OpenGL](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/LearnOpenGL)

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/LearnOpenGL/master/Images/Mixed_Texture_Rectangle.png)

OpenGL 3.3 and GL shading language 330. Follows through the tutorials of [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/Introduction) by Joey de Vries.

## [Embedded Python in Cpp Prototype](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/EmbeddedPythonInCppPrototype)

Testing and benchmarking calling functions in real-time from C++ to Python and vice versa

## [Iteration Speed Experiment](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/IterationSpeedExperiment)

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/IterationSpeedExperiment/master/Screenshot.png)

This is a quick comparison of execution speeds when applying the same iterative operation on different data structures representing a collection of 2x1 vectors. This is to investigate the impact of data access methods on execution speed within a compiled C++ release binary, such as in being able to leveraging efficient CPU and memory use.
