# Software Projects

This is a quick showcase of my presentable software projects on GitHub. You can click on each project title to see its repository page.

You can also find my [GitHub Profile here](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH) and the rest of my [Project Repositories here](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH?tab=repositories). 

# Applications

## [Omnia](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Omnia)
Languages: C++, Python

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/Omnia/master/docs/images/debug.png)

 A game engine I'm developing for fun, study and technical demonstrations. It doubles as an interactive software framework. It is designed to be customizable, general purpose, data-driven, and lightweight.

# Libraries & Add-Ons

## [Libretti](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti)
Languages: C

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti/master/Screenshot.gif)

Libretti is a music synthesizer library for integration with applications. It can compile audio data from text files that are written with [Libretti's scripting language](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti/blob/master/Documentation/Scripting%20Language%20Specification.txt)

# Scripts

## [Abstract Name Generator](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/AbstractNameGenerator)
Languages: Python

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/AbstractNameGenerator/main/Screenshot.png)

This is a script to take a syllable count from the user, generate a permutation list of abstract syllables and allow the user to choose how and which will be presented to them.

## [Source Licenser](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/SourceLicenser) 
Languages: Python

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/SourceLicenser/main/Screenshot.png)

Applies licenses to the top of all source files in a given directory according to a given LICENSE file.

## [Title Case Converter](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/TitleCaseConverter)
Languages: Python

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/TitleCaseConverter/main/Screenshot.png)

Converts an input string into title case according to the Chicago Manual of Style, with capitalization for non-grammatrical words. This may be useful, for example, in article headlines and content creation platforms.

# Archived

## [Suprannua Engine](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/SuprannuaEngine)
Languages: C

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/SuprannuaEngine/master/Documentation/Images/Screenshot.gif)

A superannuated, 2D platformer game engine codebase. My first project ever.
You can [download all the games and tests I've made with Suprannua Engine here.](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/SuprannuaEngine/releases/download/v0.14.0-alpha/Suprannua.0.14.0.Games.Tests.zip). All movement is done through WASD keys where not specified.

# Just For My Learning

Prototypes to test concepts before implementing them in other projects.

## [Iteration Speed Experiment](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/IterationSpeedExperiment)

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/IterationSpeedExperiment/master/Screenshot.png)

This is a quick comparison of execution speeds when applying the same iterative operation on different data structures representing a collection of 2x1 vectors. This is to investigate the impact of data access methods on execution speed within a compiled C++ release binary, such as in being able to leveraging efficient CPU and memory use.
